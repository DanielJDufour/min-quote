# min-quote
Minimally Quote a String.  Avoid Extra Escape Characters.

# motivation
Code that escapes a quote in a string with a backslash includes an extra character (8 bits).
This library aims to avoid the extra backslash by choosing `"`, `'`, or <code>`</code>
depending on if a quoting character is in the string.  This is especially helpful
if you have a JavaScript file with thousands of strings. 

# install
```bash
npm install min-quote
```

# usage
```js
import minQuote from 'min-quote';

minQuote('The cow jumped over the moon');
// 'The cow jumped over the moon'

minQuote("It's awesome.");
// "It's Awesome"

minQuote(`"Don't count the days, make the days count." - Muhammad Ali`);
// `"Donâ€™t count the days, make the days count." - Muhammad Ali`
